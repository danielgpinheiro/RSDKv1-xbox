# RSDKv1 to Original Xbox - Sonic Nexus (2008, RSDK) Decompilation
A Full Decompilation of Sonic Nexus (2008), a Retro Engine game made by Taxman.

# About the project

- This fork over the port for Original Xbox
- This is Retro Engine v1, compatible with Sonic Nexus
- To run this, you need the game's assets. Put Data.bin in the root of the same folder where the .xbe executable is. You find the game assets where. [Sonic Nexus Assets.](https://info.sonicretro.org/Sonic_Nexus)

## Original Xbox Controls

- D-pad or Left Analog Stick - Movement
- A Button - Jump
- B Button - Dash
- Start Button - Pause
- Back Button - Exit Game

## Recurring problems

- The intro gif cutscene don't render properly, press start to skip to start screen.

## Build Original Xbox binaries / xISO

First, you need to configure nxdk according to your operating system, you can see that [here](https://github.com/XboxDev/nxdk/wiki/Install-the-Prerequisites)

After that, compile using these commands in the terminal

```bash

git clone --recursive https://github.com/danielgpinheiro/RSDKv1-xbox.git

./dependencies/xbox/nxdk/bin/activate

make  -f  Makefile.nxdk
```

# Original description

Without assets from the game, this decompilation will not run. You can download the game [here](https://info.sonicretro.org/Sonic_Nexus).

# Additional Tweaks
* Added a built in mod loader, allowing to easily create and play mods.
* There is now a `settings.ini` file that the game uses to load all settings, similar to Sonic Mania.
* Dev menu can now be accessed from anywhere by pressing the `ESC` key if enabled in the config.
* The `F12` pause, `F11` step over & fast forward debug features from Sonic Mania have all been ported and are enabled if `devMenu` is enabled in the config.

# How to build
## Windows
* Clone the repo, then follow the instructions in the [depencencies readme for Windows](./dependencies/windows/dependencies.txt) to setup dependencies, then build via the visual studio solution.
* Alternatively, you can grab a prebuilt executable from the releases section.

## Mac
* Clone the repo, follow the instructions in the [depencencies readme for Mac](./dependencies/mac/dependencies.txt) to setup dependencies, then build via the Xcode project.

## Linux
* To setup your build enviroment and library dependecies, run the following commands:
  * Ubuntu (Mint, Pop!_OS, etc...): `sudo apt install build-essential git libsdl2-dev libvorbis-dev libogg-dev libtheora-dev`
  * Arch Linux: `sudo pacman -S base-devel git sdl2 libvorbis libogg libtheora`
* Clone the repo with the following command: `git clone https://github.com/Rubberduckycooly/Sonic-Nexus-Decompilation.git`
* Go into the repo you just cloned with `cd Sonic-Nexus-Decompilation`.
* Then run `make CXXFLAGS=-O2 -j5`.
  * If your distro is using gcc 8.x.x, then add the argument `LIBS=-lstdc++fs`.
  * The `CXXFLAGS` option can be removed if you do not want optimizations.
  * -j switch is optional, but will make building faster by running it parallel on multiple cores (8 cores would be -j9.)

## Unofficial Branches
Follow the installation instructions in the readme of each branch.
* For the **Nintendo Switch**, go to [LittlePlanetCD's fork](https://github.com/LittlePlanetCD/Sonic-Nexus-Switch).
  
Because these branches are unofficial, we can't provide support for them and they may not be up-to-date.

## Other Platforms
Currently the only supported platforms are the ones listed above, however the backend uses libogg, libvorbis, libtheora & SDL2 to power it, so the codebase is very multiplatform. If you're able to, you can clone this repo and port it to a platform not on the list.
